# Occupancy Detection using PCA and Classification Algorithms

## Abstract

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) stands as a cornerstone method in the realm of data science, especially when dealing with extensive datasets. Its primary objective is to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets, transforming correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated ones. In this study, PCA is employed to the Occupancy detection dataset with a goal to discern the presence or absence of occupants within a space. We further explore the efficacy of three prominent classification algorithms—Extra Trees (ET), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF)—on both the original dataset and its PCA-transformed counterpart. With each algorithm meticulously fine-tuned with optimal hyperparameters, we benchmark their performance utilizing various metrics, including the F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. Notably, ET emerged a
